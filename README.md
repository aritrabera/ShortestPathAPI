# ShortestPathAPI
#The implementation is based on the above algorithm and code snippet. I have created a Springboot restful webservice application that accepts a JSON with all the devices (Routers, Modem, Switch, Gateway Router) with (X, Y) coordinates. The application parses n number of devices from the input JSON and creates a (n*n) matrix for the Dijkstra's algorithm and calculates and returns the shortest path and distance from the Gateway router to each router and end devices. It also returns the hop count of each of the paths. The data is retuned as a JSON and can be read from the swagger.
